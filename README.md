### What is Git?

Before using Git, one must understand Git. Please read through
[What is Git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)
before going any further with Git. Here are a few particularly important zingers from the article:

- "...if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then
  using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you..."
- "Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to
  operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your
network..."
- "You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it..."
- "...we know we can experiment without the danger of severely screwing things up..."
- "Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged,
  and committed..."
