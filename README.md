### What is Git?

Before using Git, one must understand Git. Please read through
[What is Git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)
before going any further with Git. Here are a few particularly important zingers from the article:

- "...if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then
  using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you..."
- "Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to
  operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your
network..."
- "You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it..."
- "...we know we can experiment without the danger of severely screwing things up..."
- "Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged,
  and committed..."

### Installation

Depending on your operating system, you might already have Git. Before trying
to install, run the following command in your shell:

```
git --version
```

If it's already installed, the output of that command should look like `git
version 2.26.0`. If your version is anything below 2.22.x, you need to consider
an update of the Git installation on your local machine. Versions before this
are no longer maintained.

Otherwise, please follow the instructions for each operating system:

- [Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_linux)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_windows)
- [Git for macOS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos)
