# Guides & References for Sokol-Hessner Lab

Welcome to the technical resources page for The Sokol-Hessner Lab. The repo
contains collections of "how-to" technical guides, templates, useful references and various
tidbits of information. While many of the resources herein were written with
our lab's needs in mind, we encourage other labs and collaborators to take
advantage our learnings.

The following Guides & References links should be your primary method of navigating
resources.

Please note: This is a living, breathing repo that will be updated from time to
time. We will do our best to maintain a stable version of all resources that
you can rely on, but sometimes changes are unavoidable (i.e., when dependencies
themselves are changed).
