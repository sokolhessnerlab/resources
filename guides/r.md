## `shlab` Packages

In the Sokol-Hessner Lab, we have a few dedicated R packages that we've built
for our tasks and their data analyses needs. The benefit of using packages are
myriad, but a few great ones to keep in mind are:

1. Packages can be developed with documentation that requires very little
   effort to maintain with the help of [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html).
2. The business logic of task and analysis methods is separated from the data
   with which it interacts.
3. We can use the same code for many purposes, instead of rewriting or
   duplicating code many times for each purpose.

### Our Packages

At the moment, the packages we are actively developing and maintaining are:

- [`shlab.imgct`](https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/shlab.imgct)
- [`shlab.utils`](https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/shlab.utils)
